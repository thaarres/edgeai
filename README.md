# Projects: Efficient edge AI for physics (and beyond)

Our research group specializes in cutting-edge inference techniques on specialized hardware, focusing on FPGA and SoC platforms. Our work is at the forefront of ultra-low latency inference (neural networks and decision trees), neural network compression, tailored for high-performance computing environments. Our group is dedicated to advancing the field of edge AI by optimizing algorithms for efficiency and speed, making significant contributions to real-time data processing and analysis.
This document lists open and past projects at the intersection of edge AI and physics, particularly focusing on innovative applications within experimental physics environments like the LHC. These projects aim to leverage machine learning techniques to solve complex problems in physics research and beyond.
